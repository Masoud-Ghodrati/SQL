## SQL Server ML Services End-to-End - code sample

In order to set this up, you'll need to restore from the `WineQuality.bak` file. You'll also need to [configure SQL Server ML Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install?view=sql-server-2017) on whatever device you want to run this sample on.  

You can then either run through the .ipynb file or the .sql file to create and train the model.
